A simple chatbot recommender system made as a mini-project. 

You can clone the repo, install the requirements using ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’, and then run the webapp locally using ‘streamlit run app.py’. Sign in as “user_220” if you’d like to recreate my examples and/or try to break them. I’ve tested this on a clean setup on my local device, but if there are any problems, please email me at ‘achen2c@gmail.com’ and I’ll work to fix them.
